## Install instructions

## Test instructions

Go to the root of the project and run:

```
yarn test
```

## Run on Android Emulator

Ensure you have an emulator set up and running. Go to Android Virtual Device Manager and launch an AVD in emulator

In a terminal type:

```
adb devices
```

You should see something like:

```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
```

Ensure you at the root of the project folder and run:

```
react-native run-android
```

## Run on iOS Simulator

Ensure you are at the root of the project folder and run:

## Caveats

- Map screen is only supported on iOS. Android requires a Goole Map account and additional config.
- Search is by mission name not by rocket name to show filtering
- Thumbnail placeholders have been used for launches with missing patches
- Unit Tests are basic snapshots. In a production app I'd use Enzyme.
