## Caveats

This spaceX app is intended to be an MVP that could be delivered in hours not days. Some nice to haves if time permitted:

- Search is by mission name not by rocket name to show filtering
- Splash screens
- Fix all typescript linting errors
- Animated loading screen
- Map page with launch site pins by lat/long coordinates
- Infinite scroll in mission list
- Unit tests for reducers, screens, navigators etc
- More rocket info
